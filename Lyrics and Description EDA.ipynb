If they turn false, then we know there is an issue or bug somewhere in our code.  In our case, if the results of our descriptive statistics funciton returned values different than what is in the assertion statement, it would tell us there's an issue with our function and we should look for a way to correct it.  For example, if we returned a token number different than 13, the assertion statement would register an error."
